# Unity Demos
Some demos made in Unity while I'm learning stuff
This is mostly focused on CG, shader programming and 3D math.

Most of the code is written by me, even if im just following another tutorial (no copypasta because that way you dont learn)
Some code utilities i got from the forums, I tried to link everything I get from someone else, if there's code from someone whos not credit, please tell me so I can add it.

Procedural meshes mostly from these tutorials: <https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/>
A decent chunk of the shader library is based on tutorials from Ben Cloward: <https://www.youtube.com/@BenCloward>
Also a part of post processing was based on Acerola's channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t>
