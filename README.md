# UnityDemos
Some demos made in Unity while I'm learning stuff
This is mostly focused on CG, shader programming and 3D math.

Most of the code is written by me, even if im just following another tutorial (no copypasta because that way you dont learn)
Some code utilities i got from the forums, I tried to link everything I get from someone else, if there's code from someone whos not credite, please tell me so I can add it.

Most of the demos are from these tutorials:
